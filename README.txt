# Iris Dataset Analysis with Unsupervised Learning

This project explores unsupervised learning techniques using Python's Scikit-Learn library to analyze the famous Iris dataset. The notebook demonstrates:

- Loading and visualizing the Iris dataset.
- Implementing clustering algorithms including KMeans and DBSCAN.
- Reducing dimensionality with PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
- Visualizing high-dimensional data using t-SNE.
- Interpreting clustering results to understand data patterns and groupings.

## Files

- `Iris_df(KMeans,DBSCAN, PCA,t-SNE).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing detailed implementations and visualizations.
- `Notebook PDF.pdf`: A PDF version of the Jupyter Notebook for accessing full visualizations in static form.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and its contents.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the well-known Iris dataset, which includes measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.

## Note on Interactive Graphs

Due to GitHub's limitations on rendering Jupyter Notebooks, interactive Plotly graphs are not displayed directly. For complete visualizations, please view the Notebook PDF or use platforms like nbviewer.
